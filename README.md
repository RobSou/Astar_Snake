# A* Snake game
this is a program where it plays the classic snake game completely autonomus, using the A* algoritm.
There are a few things to get that work
  1. It calculates the distance with a special metric to find the most rect path.
  2. It finds the best path to the food and goes for only if there's a path to the tail
  3. If don't find the path, it tries to reach the tail
There exist a lot of things to make it better, but, for now it works very well.
